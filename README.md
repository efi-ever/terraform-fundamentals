ðŸ’¡ **About Terraform**

Terraform serves as an infrastructure as code (IaC) tool designed to automate the provisioning and management of cloud resources. Users define their desired infrastructure configuration using HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL), allowing for the creation, modification, and scaling of resources across various cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. Its core functionalities include a declarative syntax, modular design with reusable components called modules, and a "plan" execution model that calculates and presents actions needed to achieve the desired state. Terraform enhances collaboration, ensures infrastructure consistency, and supports a version-controlled, collaborative approach to managing cloud environments.
